"""
Macro for supporting custom resource set typically defined in Gradle via source sets.

Bazel expects all resources to be in same root `res` directory but Gradle does not have this
limitation. This macro receives directory on file system and copies the required resources to
Bazel compatible `res` folder during build.

    This macro make sures the given `resource_files` are present in a bazel compatible folder by
    copying them to correct directory.

    Args:
      target: The label of the target for which resources should be made compatible.
      dir_name: The root name of the folder which needs to be fixed i.e the one that is not `res`
      resource_files: The list of files that should be copied to. Usually a result of `glob` function.

    Returns:
